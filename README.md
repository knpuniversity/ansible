# Ansible for Automation!

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script for the
[Ansible for Automation!](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/ansible)
course on KnpUniversity.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Setup parameters.yml**

First, make sure you have an `app/config/parameters.yml`
file (you should). If you don't, copy `app/config/parameters.yml.dist`
to get it:

```
cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml
```

Next, look at the configuration and make any adjustments you
need (like `database_password`).

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Setup the Database**

Again, make sure `app/config/parameters.yml` is setup
for your computer. Then, create the database and the
schema!

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console hautelook_alice:doctrine:fixtures:load
```

If you get an error that the database exists, that should
be ok. But if you have problems, completely drop the
database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.

**Build Assets**

The assets are built with Webpack Encore. First, make sure
you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed. Then:

```
yarn
yarn encore dev
```

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`

**For convenience**

If you are using PhpStorm you may install and enable
the [Symfony Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/7219-symfony-plugin)
via the preferences which provides more auto-completion for Symfony projects.

Have fun!
